## FAQ
### What's a CGF?
A CGF (Computer Generated Force) is a computer program that allows virtual forces to be used in simulations. These forces are made up of entities and are not necessarily military in nature. CGFs are the backbone of many simulations and provide the logic and guidance for the rest of the simulators to follow.

### OK, but why do we need an open-source one?
Great question! The vast majority of CGFs are closed and proprietary. This basically excludes small businesses and acedmia from making use of them. In essence, it creates an artifically high barrier for entry. We believe that creating a basic, generic CGF for all will stimulate the growth of a wide range of other simulation systems which will benefit the field in the long-run.

### I already use 'x'-CGF why should I change to yours?
The short answer is: you don't have to. We plan on sitting alongside the big players to provide a basic service that you can use to develop your own application/systems. As we use open standards (DIS & HLA), anything that works with us, will work with anyone else. We don't want to tie you in with proprietary systems that don't play nice. All we want is for you to have access to a CGF that won't break the bank.

### Sounds good, but what's the catch? How do you make money?
There's no catch. Open-CGF is free and always will be. Our business model is to provide paid support and annual updates of data models, SISO enumerations, terrain data, etc... If you don't need those, then you don't pay. Simple really!
